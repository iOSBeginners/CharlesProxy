CharlesProxy
============

 We use this project to demonstrate how to hack an iOS application by using « Charles proxy »  There is two ways to do this :   1. Use breakpoints      We can edit the response or the request.  2. Use rewrite     We can edit automatically the host (url,path…etc), the rewrite option is very useful if  we want to change the mode of web services from preprod to prod.
