CharlesProxy
============

 We use this project to demonstrate how to hack an iOS application by using « Charles proxy »  
 
 This is an iOS project that contains a webView we will try to change the host and after this we will try to change the response of the host (the information displayed in the web view) 

 
 There is two ways to do this :  
 
1. Use breakpoints : We can edit the response or the request.  


2. Use rewrite     : We can edit automatically the host (url,path…etc), the rewrite option is very useful if  we want to change the mode of web services from preprod to prod.
